# Questionnaires in Health Sciences (QHS)


## Installation.
I will start the process to publish it to CRAN once there are enough functions in the package. At the moment, `qhs` is solely for now, solely hosted on GitHub. You can install it via the following code. 
```
devtools::install_github('MaximeBergevin/qhs')
```
